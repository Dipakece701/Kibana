KIBANA:

FILEBEAT -> LOGSTASH -> ELASTIC SEARCH -> KIBANA

Logstash: server component of logstash that processes incoming logs

Elasticsearch: stores all the logs

Kibana: web interface for searching and visualizing logs, which will be proxied through Nginx

Filebeat: Installed on client servers that will send their logs to logstash, Filebeat acts as a log shipping agent that utilizes the lumberjack networking protocol to communicate with Logstash
